Rate limiting 
=> control the amount of incoming or outgoing traffic within a network
=> securing backend APIs from malicious attacks 
=> for handling unwanted streams of requests from users
=> allows us to control the rate at which user requests are processed by our server.
=> allows us to handle user requests based on some specified constraint 
   => There is better flow of data
   => There is a reduced risk of attack
   => The server is never overloaded
   => Users can only do as much as is allowed by the developer


=> we might want to limit the number of requests an unsubscribed user can make to a public API to 1,000 requests per month
=> Once the user exceeds that number, we can ignore the request and throw an error indicating that the user has exceeded their limit.

for rate limiting to be implemented,
there must be a clearly defined constraint (limit), which can be based on any of the following
=> Users: the constraint is specific to a user 
          is implemented using a unique user identifier
=> Location: the constraint is based on geography 
             is implemented based on the location from which the request was made
=> IP addresses: the constraint is based on the IP address of the device that initiates a request
